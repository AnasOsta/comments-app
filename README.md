## My Process

### Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ‚Äì Full-stack React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚Äì Utility-first CSS framework
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ‚Äì ORM for database management
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) ‚Äì PostgreSQL database hosting
- [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/) ‚Äì For hashing passwords
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) ‚Äì Authentication library

### What I Learned

This project taught me how to build a full-featured comment system from scratch. Key learnings:

- Working with Prisma and Supabase for database management
- Hashing passwords securely using bcrypt
- Implementing a complete login system using NextAuth.js
- Building components manually instead of relying on UI libraries like `shadcn` or `framer`
- Designing scalable backend logic and clean API structure

### Continued Development

Future plans for the project include:

- Adding notifications for replies or mentions
- Enhancing UI/UX using animation libraries
- Adding user profiles and editable settings

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase project (free tier works fine)

### Installation

   cd comments-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase and NextAuth credentials:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-database-url"
   DIRECT_URL="your-supabase-direct-url"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
